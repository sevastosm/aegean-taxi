            We are a passionate and dynamic team of entrepreneurs but first and
            foremost we are travellers ourselves. We therefore understand the
            excitement of being in a new country but also the stress of trying
            to find reliable drivers to help you get from point A to Point B.
            This of course starts with the airport arrival and transfer and
            continues throughout the stay, all the way to the transfer back and
            final goodbye. This is why our motto: “Arrive-Get around-Depart”,
            encapsulates the entire spectrum of logistics a traveller might
            need.

            While travelling within Greece, we faced numerous times difficulties
            in finding reliable, quality and affordable services as well as a
            complete transport solution provider in the most popular locations
            in Greece. We started Aegean Taxi with the aim to become the
            preferred ground transportation partner who understands the needs of
            visitors and tourists in Greece, makes them feel like home and helps
            them have a relaxed and pleasant stay.

            Our story started in the island of Mykonos, when in 2015 our founder
            had to pay € 30 to another tourist to ride in the back of a scooter
            in order to get to his destination, due the lack of available
            drivers. After this experience and realising that the same situation
            was prevalent in other islands around Greece, we started working
            towards creating the first taxi application that would be dedicated
            to visiting tourists. By the end of 2015 we were the first taxi app
            in Mykonos island, bringing together a fleet of drivers and tourists
            who were looking for quality and affordable rides.

            In 2016 we expanded our service to the island of Santorini, but
            realised the difficulties in finding and training good quality
            drivers, who could offer a premium service to our clients. We then
            decided to invest in our own fleet of cars and opened our offices in
            both Mykonos and Santorini, which we used as a base for further
            expansion.
