              Taxis can be found in a number of designated taxi ranks throughout
              the city, at the arrivals area on the Athens International
              Airport, and on all ports. Hailling a taxi from the street is also
              easy, one has to look at the taxi light at the top of every car,
              when this is illuminated, it means that the taxi is free and
              available for hire
