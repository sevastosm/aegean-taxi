                We try to match the price you would pay for a regular taxi ride.
                That said, Aegean Taxi is much more than a simple ride. Our goal
                is to connect you with a taxi driver who is a proud ambassador
                of their city and who will answer any questions you might have
                about your destination, making your first moments of your
                arrival unique and memorable.
