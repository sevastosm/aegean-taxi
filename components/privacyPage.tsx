                operational purposes,Aegean taxi takes steps to prevent access

                deletion of your account at any time through the contact section
                in the Aegean taxi app, or via Aegean taxi&prime; website.
                Following such requests, Aegean taxi deletes the information
                that it is not required to retain. In certain circumstances,
                Aegean taxi may be unable to delete your account, such as if
                there is an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved
                claim or dispute. Upon resolution of the issue preventing
                deletion, Aegean taxi will delete your account as described
                above. Aegean taxi may also retain certain information if
                necessary for its legitimate business interests, such as fraud
                prevention and enhancing users&prime; safety and security. For
                example, if Aegean taxi shuts down a user&prime;s account
                because of unsafe behaviour or security incidents, Aegean taxi
                may retain certain information about that account to prevent
                that user from opening a new Aegean taxi account in the future.

                After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each

                Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for

                main menu of the Aegean taxi rider app. Your driver rating is
