            delay in such termination would expose Aegean or a third party to
            significant risk of harm or damage.

            at the discretion of the transport company providing the transport.
            The price cannot be lower than €36 for a minimum of 30 minutes in
            some jurisdictions during certain months, and varies accordingly, as

            Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the Terms contained
            in this Part 2 of this Agreement shall be exclusively governed by
            and construed in accordance with the laws of The United Kingdom,
            excluding its rules on conflicts of laws. The Vienna Convention on
            the International Sale of Goods of 1980 (CISG) shall not apply. Any

            including those relating to its validity, its construction or its
            enforceability (any “Dispute”) shall be first mandatorily submitted
            to mediation proceedings under the International Chamber of Commerce
            Mediation Rules (“ICC Mediation Rules”). If such Dispute has not
            been settled within sixty (60) days after a request for mediation
            has been submitted under such ICC Mediation Rules, such Dispute can
            be referred to and shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
            arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International
            Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Arbitration Rules”). The ICC Rules&prime;
            Emergency Arbitrator provisions are excluded. The Dispute shall be
            resolved by one (1) arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with
            the ICC Rules. The place of both mediation and arbitration shall be
            London, GB, without prejudice to any rights you may have under
            Article 18 of the Brussels I bis Regulation (OJ EU 2012 L351/1)
            and/or Article 6:236n of the Dutch Civil Code. The language of the
            mediation and/or arbitration shall be English, unless you do not
            speak English, in which case the mediation and/or arbitration shall
            be conducted in both English and your native language. The existence
            and content of the mediation and arbitration proceedings, including
            documents and briefs submitted by the parties, correspondence from
            and to the International Chamber of Commerce, correspondence from
            the mediator, and correspondence, orders and awards issued by the
            sole arbitrator, shall remain strictly confidential and shall not be
            disclosed to any third party without the express written consent
            from the other party unless: (i) the disclosure to the third party
            is reasonably required in the context of conducting the mediation or
            arbitration proceedings; and (ii) the third party agrees
            unconditionally in writing to be bound by the confidentiality
            obligation stipulated herein.
