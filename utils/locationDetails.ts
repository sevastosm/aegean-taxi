Bus schedules are typically designed to align with flight arrivals and departures. However, it's recommended to check the most current timetable either online or at the airport/port upon your arrival, as schedules may vary seasonally. A one-way bus ticket from the airport/port to popular destinations like Naxos Town (Chora) or Agios Prokopios usually costs around €5, making it a budget-friendly transportation choice. The bus journey from Naxos Airport to the island's main towns or beaches takes approximately 10-15 minutes.`,

                Short Journeys: For brief trips, you'll be charged a fixed minimum fare, making it an affordable choice for quick travels.

                Longer Journeys: Extended journeys are calculated using a taximeter, taking into account the distance traveled. The fare structure is as follows:

                Daytime Rate (05:00 to 24:00): €0.68 per kilometer

                Heraklion Taxi Tips
                Keep in mind that nighttime travel comes with a slightly higher per-kilometer rate (€1.36), so consider this when planning your journey.
                Heraklion taxis are equipped to handle standard luggage, but remember that excess weight may result in additional fees.
                Be sure to inquire about any potential extra charges for specific services before beginning your trip.
