        taxi_information: `Fare Structure
                Heraklion taxi fares are closely monitored and regulated by the local authorities, ensuring fairness and transparency in pricing. The fare structure depends on the nature of your journey:

                Short Journeys: For brief trips, you'll be charged a fixed minimum fare, making it an affordable choice for quick travels.

                Longer Journeys: Extended journeys are calculated using a taximeter, taking into account the distance traveled. The fare structure is as follows:

                Base Fare: €3
                Daytime Rate (05:00 to 24:00): €0.68 per kilometer
                Nighttime Rate (24:00 to 05:00): €1.36 per kilometer
                Additional charges may apply for specific services:

                Baggage exceeding 10kg: €0.40
                Surcharge for pickups from designated locations such as the train station, bus station, and port: €1.07
                Waiting time (one hour): €10.85
                Hailing Your Heraklion Taxi
                Securing a taxi on Heraklion Island is a breeze, thanks to various convenient methods. You can easily flag one down on the street, head to a taxi rank, or get in touch with local radio taxi companies. Regardless of your choice, reliable transportation is just a call or a wave away.

                Heraklion Taxi Tips
                Keep in mind that nighttime travel comes with a slightly higher per-kilometer rate (€1.36), so consider this when planning your journey.
                Heraklion taxis are equipped to handle standard luggage, but remember that excess weight may result in additional fees.
                Be sure to inquire about any potential extra charges for specific services before beginning your trip.
                If you choose a taximeter-based fare, ensure the driver resets it to the base fare of €3 at the start of your journey.

                Safe and Efficient Travel
                Exploring the wonders of Heraklion Island becomes a seamless experience when you rely on its well-regulated taxi services. Whether you're indulging in a leisurely vacation or have a packed itinerary, Heraklion taxis offer the ideal blend of convenience and efficiency for your island adventure.
